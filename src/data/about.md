# Currently

I am currently based near Kirkland, Washington as a Restaurant Manager at [Zeeks Pizza](https://zeekspizza.com/locations/). I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, sell products, and build professional relationships with multi-million dollar buisness owners.

# Some history

- Grew up in Honolulu, Hawaii

- Ate lots of spam musubi, drank loads of guava juice, and had lots of beach days with the family.

- Spent the rest of my childhood in the Pacific Northwest.

- Graduated community college in spring 2019 with an Associated Degree.

- Got promoted to Restaurant Manager in early 2020. Managed a team of close to 30 employees.

- After I graduated community college I didn't know what I wanted to do for my professional career. One day my Dad told me about Bethel School of Technology, had an informational interview with an advisor, about 6 months later I visited Bethel Tech's headquarters and met the CEO, Ryan Collins! I got some confirmation that I was supposed to attend this coding bootcamp. 

- About one and a half years later after I visited Bethel Tech, I moved to Northern California and started Bethel Tech!

- I recently graduated Bethel Tech on July 11th, 2021! I specialized in Full Stack Development.
